* **dataset**: downloaded from `pytorch` dataset library.

## Handwriting Classifier using Convolutional Network
This repository contains a **handwriting classification model** implemented using PyTorch. The model is designed to recognize handwritten characters or digits, trained on a dataset such as MNIST or EMNIST. The project is optimized for training on a laptop and can be used for educational purposes or as a starting point for more complex handwriting recognition tasks.

- **CNN-based Model**: A lightweight convolutional neural network for handwriting classification.
- **Easy-to-Use**: Simple scripts for training, evaluation, and inference.
- **Customizable**: Easy to modify the model architecture or dataset for your needs.
